          At <strong>Farmer Harvest</strong>, we strive to ensure a seamless shopping experience for our customers while respecting the policies set by our Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) partners. As an aggregator marketplace, our role in the return and refund process is limited, and the policies vary depending on the seller.
